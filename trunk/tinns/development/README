Quick and dirty readme file for TinNS
--------------------------------------


To install TinNS, you have to edit the Makefile first.
Search for "mysql.h" and put that path in "inc="
Search for "libmysqlclient.a" and put that path in "lib="

Now type "make" to compile TinNS. You'll get a few warnings in HawkNL,
just ignore them.

If you have problems while compiling, ask in the forum!
