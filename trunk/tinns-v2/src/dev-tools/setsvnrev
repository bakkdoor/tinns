# How this works:                                         #
#    Everytime you do "make", this script is called.      #
#    It will check the current svn headerfile if its      #
#    a new revision or just a recompile.                  #
#    IF it is a new revision, the script tries to get     #
#    the actual version from the official SVN             #
#    tool "svnversion". If your server has no SVN         #
#    installed (like mine) or it is outdated for some     #
#    reason, an alternative way is choosen. A custom      #
#    script is called which tries to readout the          #
#    .svn/entries file for the revision number.           #
#    This number is then written to svnrev.h, compiled    #
#    into Patch, Info and Gameserver, and can be viewed   #
#    ingame by typing @version                            #
