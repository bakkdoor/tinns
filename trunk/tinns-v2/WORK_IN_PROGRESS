The purpose of this proposed file is to give a fairly up to date view
on the work in progress, to avoid double work...

The aim of the modifications I'm on is to have a full character login,
that is a char that displays as expected ingame (for himself at first),
and has his stats and changes well kept in DB.

It involves modification of:
 - [DONE] full char creation with use of profession templates (for money and inventory)
    except for :
      - remaining SP calculation
      - starting XP calculation
 - additions and modifications on some char data definitions
 - char items and containers management
 - [DONE] char data saving in DB including inventory
     But belt, implants & armor, chat conf and other secondary info not implemented yet
 - modifications to char loading from DB
    [DONE] for inventory
    [NOT DONE] for rest of char items and complementary infos (see above)
 - minor modifications to autosave
    [DONE] but more improvements will have to be done when more efficiency needed
 - [DONE]full filling-in of the baseline for char visual aspects, stats and inventory
