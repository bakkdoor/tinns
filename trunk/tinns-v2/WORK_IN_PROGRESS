The purpose of this proposed file is to give a fairly up to date view
on the work in progress, to avoid double work...

The aim of current modifications are to change a bit of the general architecture of TinNS
[DONE] Source tree, Makefiles, and includes will first be reorganised to permit more modularity and code sharing amongst the 3 servers,
 and easy exclusion of unfinished code.
 Some Makefile targets to facilitate common code individual compilation remains to be done

The aim of some modifications I'll restart later will be to to finish the full character login,
that is a char that displays as expected ingame (for himself at first),
and has his stats, equipment and changes well kept in DB.

It involves modification of:
 - [DONE] full char creation with use of profession templates (for money and inventory)
    except for :
      - remaining SP calculation
      - starting XP calculation
 - additions and modifications on some char data definitions
 - char items and containers management
 - [DONE] char data saving in DB including inventory
     But belt, implants & armor, chat conf and other secondary info not implemented yet
 - modifications to char loading from DB
    [DONE] for inventory
    [NOT DONE] for rest of char items and complementary infos (see above)
 - minor modifications to autosave
    [DONE] but more improvements will have to be done when more efficiency needed
 - [DONE]full filling-in of the baseline for char visual aspects, stats and inventory

Other current work:
 - [DONE] make use of worldinfo.def, appplaces.def, appartments.def, respawn.def to manage genreping and
    appartment in/out rather than hardcoded info (e.g. zoning.cpp) and manually built database.
 - make use of world .dat files and worldmodels.def to manage item use rather than
    a manually built database.
