You need cmake to build tinns and its tools.

cmake is part of nearly all linux distributions and you may need to install
first.

debian/ubuntu: "apt-get install cmake"
suse (11.0+): "zypper in cmake"

After installing cmake just use it with the CMakeLists.txt file in this
directory.

"cmake CMakeLists.txt"

cmake will now create a full buildsystem which can be used with the plain
GNU make and checks for all missing packages/libs. You will get notified if
something is missing.

"cmake_distclean.sh" removes all cache and temp files from the cmake
buildsystem.
