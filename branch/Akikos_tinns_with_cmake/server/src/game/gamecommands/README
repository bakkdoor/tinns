How to add new IngameCommands:

- Write your gamecommand into a single .cpp file. No return value, no parameters.
  The function name should be: doCmd<yourcommand>
  also, add this method to class PCommands.
  Example:
  	void PCommands::doCmdExampe() {};
  	
- Open commands.h: Add the command-function prototype to the class
- Open commands.cpp: Add a new else if() for your command
- If your command is a developer command, make sure to add it to PCommands::IsDevCommand()
- If your command works with the packetdumb instead of pre-striped args, make sure to add
  your command to PCommands::RequirePacketDumb()
- Open configtemplate.h: Add a new default level for your command
- Open commands.conf: Add the command.
- Save everything

 Done :)
