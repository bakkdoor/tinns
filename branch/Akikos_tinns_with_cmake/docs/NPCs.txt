So far, if you type
   @test 1
   A copbot will spawn at your current location

   @test 5 <your local ID> 17
   the copbot will put out his weapon and run to a location in Plaza 1, left
to medicare (i had to set a static pos here)

   @test 6 <your local ID> 0 4863
   the copbot will start shooting you.

   type
   @test 5 0 15
   and the copbot will put back his weapon and stop fire
