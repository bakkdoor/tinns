Current @test commands are:

@text 1 <npcID> <zoneID> <unknown1> <attackAnim>
- Let <npcID> (use @debug it) attack <zoneID> which can be any npc or
player
  <npcID>: For non-sql NPCs, you have to remove an offset of 255; So the left
security officer
  in plaza 1 would have id 48 instead of 303
  Unknown 1 is .. unknown yet and seems to be unimportant
  attackAnim is the attack "style" of <npcID>. Varies from npc type to npc
type

@test 2 <faction ID> <faction ID>
- Get relation of the 2 given factions. <0 means enemy


! IF you find out what an "unknown" value does, tell us !
