# TinNS (TinNS is not a Neocron Server)

This is a mirror of the official svn repo hosted at http://www.linux-addicted.net/
I worked on this a couple of years ago and I thought it might be nice to have a mirror here if anyone is interested.

# What is it?

TinNS is a reverse engineered server for Neocron 1, a by now outdated cyberpunk-genre MMORPG, see: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neocron
